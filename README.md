# Bitwise Operations in C

This project is a simple C program that performs bitwise operations on binary strings. It takes two binary strings and an operator as command-line arguments, performs the specified bitwise operation, and outputs the result in both binary and decimal formats.

## Features

- Converts decimal numbers to binary strings and vice versa.
- Pads binary strings with leading zeros to ensure they are of equal length.
- Supports bitwise operations: AND, OR, and XOR.

## Usage

Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:


Run the program with the following command-line arguments:



- `<binary1>`: The first binary string.
- `<operator>`: The bitwise operator, which can be `-and`, `-or`, or `-xor`.
- `<binary2>`: The second binary string.

### Example

This will output the result of the bitwise AND operation between the binary strings `1010` and `1100`.

## Output

The program outputs the result of the operation in both binary and decimal formats, along with the length of the bit strings used.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
